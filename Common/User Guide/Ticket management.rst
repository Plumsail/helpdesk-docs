View ticket
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can open up a ticket by clicking its title. You will be presented
with a form like this one:

|view-ticket-form|

You can see the Discussion tab with the conversation between agent and
requester. You may notice a small lock underneath an agent’s name, it
tells that this message is a private note that is visible to agents only
and not to the requester. The requester will not receive any
notification about it and will not be able to read it. Also, there is a
list of attachments on the right side of the view, below Due Date.

The ticket's change history can be opened by clicking the History tab:

|history-tab|

Once you opened the ticket form as the assignee, it is marked as read.
But certainly, you may want to mark the ticket as unread right from the
form you are currently in. To do this open HelpDesk ribbon tab and click
Mark as unread button (make sure you are the assignee of the ticket).

You can also open a ticket by entering its ID in the box and hitting
Enter.

Most of the ticket fields are displayed in the table on the right-hand
side of the screen:

   (if the contact has his organization specified you’ll see it next to
   his name).

Assigned to

   ticket.

Cc
   Carbon copy. Contacts specified in this field will receive the
   same notifications as the requester.

   progress and Solved. You can also add your own.
