All tickets
###########

All tickets is a module where you can view a list of all tickets and
filter them by creation date or by due date. Navigate to all tickets
using the icon in the navigation panel on the right-hand side:

|tickets_icon|

Here you can see list of all tickets and filter them. The filters are
positioned at the top of the view:

|alltickets_2|

On the custom period page you can specify a period of dates for
filtering by creation date:

|alltickets_custom_2|

If you don’t specify “From” or “To” inputs, default values will be used:
01/01/1970 for “From” and 5 years from now for “To”.
