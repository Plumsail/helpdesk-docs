Home views
~~~~~~~~~~

You can navigate to several built-in views using links at the top of the
page. There is a counter of tickets below each link.

All new and updated tickets are auto marked as unread. An example of
such ticket is shown below:

**Note:** Unread tickets are displayed as unread for the assignee only.
Bold typing is used in “My tickets” and “My overdue” views only.

Here is the list of built-in views:

-  My tiсkets - all tickets assigned to you. (Tickets that have you
   specified in the “Assigned to” field).
-  Requested by me - all tickets requested by you. (Tickets that have
   you specified in the “Requester” field).
-  My overdue - tickets assigned to me with Due date before today.
-  Group tickets - tickets assigned to SharePoint groups that I belong
   to. (You can assign tickets to SharePoint groups, e.g.”IT Support”).
-  Unassigned - all tickets with an empty “Assigned to” field.
-  Unread - all unread tickets assigned to you.

Resolved tickets are not displayed in any of the home views.

How to add a new view

You have several standard SharePoint ways to create your own custom

Mark tickets as read or unread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a ticket is created or updated it is marked as unread for the
assignee. All unread tickets are displayed with bold typed titles andW
ids in “My tickets” and “My overdue” views. There is also a separate
Unread view, where the agent can see all unread tickets.

You can mark tickets as read or as unread manually. Select single or
multiple tickets in the view, switch to “HelpDesk” tab in the ribbon and
click “Mark as Read” or “Mark as Unread” button:
