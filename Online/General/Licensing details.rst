	What is an instance?
		HelpDesk instance is a single installation to single SharePoint site.

As for the rest, all plans have the same features. The only difference is in a number of comments, agents and, as it was mentioned above, instances. When you will get close to spent 70% of your monthly comments, we will send you a notification about it. Thus, you will have enough time to `purchase additional 500 comments`_ or pay a differential cost to start using another plan. Unfortunately, if you ran out of comments in this month, we will be forced to stop synchronization of your mail and you will not be allowed to create comments from the widget and via user interface as well.   

Likely you start using Plumsail HelpDesk with a trial. The trial version gives you an opportunity to try our product with no limits. The trial period lasts for 30 days. If you choose not to purchase one of three plans, the help desk will stop working. For more details about plans, take a look at the table below.

    Who is an agent?
	  Agent is a SharePoint user that processes tickets. Agents unlike members, receive notifications about new unassigned tickets. There is a Role column in the  `contacts`_  list. User is an agent if his role is "Agent".


Plumsail Forms license
----------------------
When you purchase Helpdesk "Yacht" or "Ocean liner" plan you receive a special `Plumsail Forms <https://plumsail.com/forms/>`_ license that allows modifying Helpdesk forms:

- You can customize only forms in the Tickets, Contacts, and Organizations lists by default.
- If you want to customize other lists you need to `buy Plumsail Forms subscription <https://plumsail.com/forms/store/>`_.
- You will see trial message in Plumsail Forms UI. It is because you don't have full subscription. You are still able to customize HelpDesk forms.
