Licensing details for HelpDesk for Office 365
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose your billing cycle â€” purchase for one year or pay month-to-month. The subscription is linked to SharePoint Online domain (yourdomain.sharepoint.com). Depending on your plan, you can create one help desk instance within your SharePoint Online domain or unlimited help desk instances. 

.. glossary::

	What is an instance?
		HelpDesk instance is a single installation to single SharePoint site.

As for the rest, all plans have the same features. The only difference is in a number of comments, agents and, as it was mentioned above, instances. When you will get close to spent 85% of your monthly comments, we will send you a notification about it. Thus, you will have enough time to purchase additional 500 comments or pay a differential cost to start using another plan. Unfortunately, if you ran out of comments in this month, we will be forced to stop synchronization of your mail and you will not be allowed to create comments from the widget and via user interface as well.   

Likely you start using Plumsail HelpDesk with a trial. The trial version gives you an opportunity to try our product with no limits. The trial period lasts for 30 days. If you choose not to purchase one of three plans, the help desk will stop working. For more details about plans, take a look at the table below.
