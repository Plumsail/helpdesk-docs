Ticket merging
##############

If you have similar tickets, you can merge them into one ticket.

You can merge tickets with different requesters — the requester and 
Cc of the ticket you close will be added as Cc of the ticket you merge 
into. The other fields like Priority, Tags, Status etc., are not 
merged as the ticket is closed during the merge.

To merge tickets, open the ticket you’d like to merge into another. 
Then click on the **Merge** button in the top-left menu. 
|Merge|
You'll see a pop-up window where you need to enter ticket ID to merge into.

|MergePopUp|

After that, the ticket was marked as “Solved” and you need to confirm merging.
You can add a closing comment to the merged ticket and send it to the client (or add a private comment).
 
|MergeConfirm|

Also, you can edit the last comment on which the ticket is merged. On the both steps, you can decide if these comments will be public or private by checking “Requester can see this comment”. Make sure that you choose the correct tickets and click “Merge”.

|MergeConfirm1|

Now your ticket was merged. Note that you can not revert this action.
