Reports

In this section, you are able to create diagrams based on all tickets,
requesters, and agents. Here you can analyze efficiency and intensity of
HelpDesk usage, personal productivity of each agent, find most active
requesters and do other kinds of information analysis with your HelpDesk
data.

Go to Reports by clicking the appropriate button in the navbar:

Plumsail product with a separate pricing.
