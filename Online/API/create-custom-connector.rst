Once you clicked *'Continue'* you will see *'General'* step of connector configuration:

You may want to differentiate this connector from others. In this case, you can assign a custom icon and custom color for it. We suggest this icon:

.. image:: ../_static/img/connector-icon.png
   :alt: Connector icon
   :target: ../_static/img/connector-icon.png

And this color:

::

  #ee8400

Then click *'Create connector'*:

   :alt: Create Connector link
