Your Plumsail HelpDesk has been temporarily suspended
#####################################################

Sometimes there are situations when HelpDesk starts producing a lot of comments for one ticket in a short period of time. 
This can happen for the following reasons:

- Plumsail HelpDesk starts communicating with some other support system and creates too many comments in a short period of time.
- Microsoft Exchange email server overrides headers in our notification emails and our services recognize those emails as new comments.
- Spamming causes producing a lot of comments for one ticket in a short period of time.

Once you resolved the issue, send a message to support@plumsail.com. We will enable your help desk.
All new tickets and comments that were created during suspension will be processed after enabling your helpdesk automatically.
