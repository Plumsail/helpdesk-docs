Here you can find how to customize ticket form in your ticketing system with adding new columns to it.

First of all, head to ticket list settings.

|ListSettings|

Select ‘Create column’. 

|CreateColumn|

Choose column type which goes along with your task and decide if the information in this column should be optional or required. 

|ColumnSettings|

To put the column into action, place it on the ticket form with the help of `Forms Designer <https://spform.com/>`_. You can find more information about forms customization in `this article <../Configuration%20Guide/Ticket%20and%20contact%20forms%20customization.html>`_.

|FormsDesigner|

Finally, you can place the newly created column in three types of forms — Edit, New, and Display. Choose one of them and drag your column from left-side bar to template of the ticket form.

It’s important to save each type of form separately otherwise, a pattern of editing form will be applied to others.

|Save|

This how your ticket's editing form will look like:
